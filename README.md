# Quantum-Study
In this repository, there are some uploaded materials: </br>
1. [List of study materials](https://github.com/yangjy0826/Quantum-Study/blob/master/List%20of%20materials%20for%20quantum%20study.xlsx) for quantum computing in excel </br>
2. [Mind map](https://github.com/yangjy0826/Quantum-Study/blob/master/Quantum%20Computing%20-%20Mind%20Map.png) created by myself for quantum computing and quantum information </br>
3. The folder [study notes](https://github.com/yangjy0826/Quantum-Study/tree/master/study%20notes) includes my notes on Quantum Computing by hand: </br>
    * [Notes for basic quantum computing knowledge](https://github.com/yangjy0826/Quantum-Study/blob/master/study%20notes/quantum%20computing.pdf)
    * [Notes for the IBM Quanrum Computing Lecture at KTH](https://github.com/yangjy0826/Quantum-Study/blob/master/study%20notes/IBM.pdf)
